# Read Me

This is a TypeScript project for NodeJS, with sane defaults for code style and linting. Just clone and go!

There are a few defaults that should be changed however, like package `name`, `cmd-name`, and `author`. You can find those in the [package.json](/package.json). Depending on your project, you may also want to change the `license` property as well. By default, this project is [MIT](/LICENSE.md) licensed.

## Commit Syntax

You may or may not like the syntax guidelines outlined in the [Commit Syntax](/docs/commit_syntax.md) Doc file. These guidelines are specific to my own projects, but you're free to use if you find them useful.

### Install

`npm i`

### Execute

`node .`

### Test Typescript Source Stack Trace

`node . throw`
